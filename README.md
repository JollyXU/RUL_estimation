# Remaining Useful Lifetime estimation

This repository holds the results of a project on Remaining Useful Lifetime estimation of a turbofan engine, conducted in the context of the course Sensor Signal and Data Processing at Delft Unviersity of Technology. The implemented estimation technique relies on an Extended Kalman Filter.

All visualization and implementation related tasks were conducted in Matlab. The code is provided in three different files: `RUL_data_exploration.m`, `RUL_function_derivations.m` and `RUL_EKF_implementation_evaluation.m` along with the required (Matlab) data file `RUL_data.mat`. The code is accompanied by comments for ease of understanding. Each file can be executed separately.

Besides the data and code, the associated report `[SSDP] Remaining Useful Lifetime estimation M. Hulsebos.pdf` is included. In this report the implementation details are discussed, where it also provides the results of the evaluation and comparison to concurrent approaches.
